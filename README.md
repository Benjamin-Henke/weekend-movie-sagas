## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This project was focused for users to save and keep movie information of their favorite movies without the the need to search the internet over and over again. 

I went for a more simplistic design. The user has a few views:
    Movie List - displays all of their current movies in a card-like display
    Add Movie - users can input any movie they desire.
    Details Page - once clicked, user will see more information about that movie.
